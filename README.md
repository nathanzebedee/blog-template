# Next.js Blog Template with GraphCMS

This is a blog template built using Next.js, JavaScript, and GraphCMS. It is designed to make it easy for developers to create their own blogs using modern web development tools.

## Features
* Built using Next.js, a powerful and efficient React framework
* Uses GraphCMS, a flexible and powerful content management system
* Comes with a pre-built layout and styling for a blog
* Easy to customize and extend with your own components and styles

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the development server, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000.

To customize the blog, you can edit the files in the components directory to change the layout and styling, and the files in the pages directory to change the content and routes.

To connect the blog to your GraphCMS instance, you will need to update the environment variables in the .env.local file with your own API keys.
